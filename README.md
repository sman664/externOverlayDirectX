Many thanks to GuidedHacking forums, Unknowncheats.me, and CasualGamer on YT!

Steps to use:

1. Download
2. Rebuild on Visual Studio 2019
3. Start up AssaultCube
4. Run the debugger or the .exe file provided in the "Debug folder" 

Details:

ESP boots up at the same time your program does, no buttons needed.
Use "Right Mouse button" to use aimbot 
(**cursor follows player's heads that your cursor is closest to!)
